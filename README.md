## Problem

With the 64GB verson of the Steam Deck, "Other" can quicky fill your internal SSD even if you only store Games on the SD card, this "Other" is often `Shader Cache` & `CompatData`.


## Solution?

To free up some of the space you can delete the Shader Cache and/or the Compat(ability) Data, the `zShaderCacheKiller` script aims to make that process a little easier.

Rather than deleting the Shader Cache or the Compat Data, the `zShaderCacheMover` script will copy & symlink selected games Shader Cache & Compat Data to the SD card or External Drive that the game is stored, freeing up the Interal Storage.


## Is this safe?

This has had limited testing on one system, USE AT OWN RISK

## What results can I expect?

For me I has 16.2GB of "Other" data, running  `zShaderCacheKiller` dropped this down to ~7GB.

My Back 4 Blood install was also using 3.5GB of Shader Cache, this I did not want to remove, instead with `zShaderCacheMover`, these files are now on my much larger SD card. As I also duel boot with Windows 11, this also saves space as the Shader Cache is now in the same location on the SD card.

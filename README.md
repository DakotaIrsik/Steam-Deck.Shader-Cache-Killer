# Steam Deck: Shader Cache Killer

Script to Purge The Steam Decks Shader Cache/ Compat Data

## Problem

With the 64GB verson of the Steam Deck, "Other" can quicky fill your internal SSD even if you only store Games on the SD card.

For me this was a result of installing the same game several times on different SD cards which then prevented me from installing other games.

## Solution?

To free up some of the space you can delete the Shader Cache, this script aims to make that process a little easier.

## ~~Why not~~ Compdata also?

Yes if you click `compactdata`, be sure not to delete any Proton files. Games will probaby become unplayable!

~~I tested this and it broke all my Proton installs with no easy way to repair other than a Factory Reset, more research is required for other locations.~~

## Is this safe?

This has had limited testing on one system, USE AT OWN RISK

## What 

## What results can I expect?

For me I has 16.2GB of "Other" data, running this dropped this down to ~7GB

## How to use

Open `Konsole` and choose a place you want to download (I like to have all my Git Repositories in `/home/deck/repo` so instructions will be for this)

make the directory with `mkdir /home/deck/repo`

move into the directory `cd /home/deck/repo`

clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/scawp/Steam-Deck.Shader-Cache-Killer.git`

move into the directory `cd Steam-Deck.Shader-Cache-Killer`

change the permissons of the script to make it execuatable `chmod -x zShaderCacheKiller.sh`

### Testing

run `./zShaderCacheKiller.sh dry-run`

no files will be deleted.

### Live 

run `./zShaderCacheKiller.sh`

Select Caches/comptdata you wish to Delete, they are ordered by Size

Click `Delete Selected!`

## Adding to Steam

You can also add this as a non-steam game if desired, icons and banner art provided in `steamArt`
